# C10E16-Inventory
Create an Inventory application that keeps track of the inventory for a sports store. Each item has a  stock number, with the first item having a stock number of 1000. The second item has a stock number  1001, the third has stock number 1002, and so on. Along with a stock number, each item has an item  name and an amount in stock. New items can be added to the inventory at any time. When added, the  item stock number is generated and displayed to the user. Discontinued items should not be deleted  from the inventory, but rather their item name should be changed to “discontinued” and the amount  in stock should be decreased to 0. The Inventory application should use an ArrayList for maintaining  the invemtory and application output should display a menu of choices, which allow for adding an  item, discontinuing an item, and displaying the amount in stock for an item.
